      Salesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM)
      platform that helps organizations manage and grow customer relationships
      across the entire lifecycle. It unifies sales, service, marketing, and
      commerce so teams can track leads and opportunities, support customers,
      run campaigns, and transact in one place. Salesforce also provides
      analytics and visualization (e.g., dashboards and Tableau), data
      integration via MuleSoft, and a Data Cloud to unify customer data for
      personalization. Its Einstein AI features add predictions,
      recommendations, and workflow automation, while low-code tools (like Flow
      and Lightning) let users build custom apps and processes. With Slack for
      collaboration and the AppExchange marketplace for extensions, Salesforce’s
      Customer 360 approach gives businesses a customizable, secure platform to
      streamline operations and deliver more connected customer experiences.
